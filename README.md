# Facial-Expression-Recognition
1.Developed a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch,training the dataset with Keras and face
detection using OpenCV.

2.Detects the emotion of the user based on the movement of facial muscles taking in his webcam feed.It
achieved an accuracy of over 70% from a set of 6 different emotions in real time
